            <p>
                <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</b> I also go by Tase, or "chappie" online. I'm a {calculateAge()} year old
                romanian student, mentor, and software developer with a strong passion for all things tech and
                with a curious mind that often wanders off into all sorts of topics.
                While I enjoy working on a wide range of technologies, there could be the case that
                a jack of all trades is a senior of none - even so, I'm highly dynamic and always eager
                to learn and improve.
