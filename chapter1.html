        <p>
            So i've decided to start doing web development. The first (and probably most comprehensive) tutorial i'll be following will be from the big boys themselves, Mozilla. I think i still rememeber how to do a hyperlink (i think)... <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/">this!</a>. Damn i'm good.
            This whole journey will be documented on a blog... that i'll be developing while i'm learning. Pretty <i>damn smart</i> ye? (i'm soo goood) I don't think this'll get published at any point - but if it does, it means that i've managed to progress quite a bit. In that case, good job me!<br>
            For now, this whole thing has been written between some &lt;html&gt; tags, and nothing more. I'll attach screenshots as i'm expanding the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, the tutorial wants me to sketch a basic design for the site, and choose some colors and fonts. I know that this'll get changed later, but for now the design will look something like this: 
            <br><img src="images/site-iter-1.png" alt="site sketch" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
            I have no idea how i'll manage to do that split, but i'll figure it out eventually. The color i'll be using is <span style="color:#754E2D; font-weight: bold;">this brown</span> (#754E2D) which i got from <a href = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool>this fancy tool</a>. And finally, a mincraft-looking font from google. I'll probably need <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">this documentation</a> a bit later, because i have no idea how to use that font right now. For now, I just added these 3 lines in the header because Google told me to (hope those last 3 words don't become a common occurence). 
            <br><img src="images/3lineshting.png" alt="code snippet" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br> 
            Also, i've added a body and a header, although i'm not 100% sure of what those represent. From what i can remember, the header holds metadata and such, while the body holds the "visible" part of the site. And yes, i've had to google how to add and center images. I have to start getting familiar with CSS styling - so far i've used <i>display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%;</i> to center those. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Quick note about dealing with files! As far as file-names are concerned, the best practice is apparently to use all-lowercase (or whatever you want, but be aware that you should treat file-names as being case-sensitive, because in most instances they are), and hyphens. So these "-", not underscores and definitely not spaces. For example "God WhyAmI_atUBB" is a big no-no, but "god-why-am-i-at-ubb" is good!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now onto the file structure - MDN is telling me to have these:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>index.html - for the main landing page of the site</li>
            <dd>(i won't have an index for this project, because i'd like to split each chapter into a standalone page)</dd>
            <li>images folder - yes</li>
            <li>styles folder - this will contain the CSS styling for the site, somehow, somewhere</li>
            <li>scripts folder - this will contain the JavaScripts (wonder how or why i've never seen "JavaScript scripts" written in some tutorial on the internet) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Using lists is fun, but it seems too good (and easy) to be true. There must be a different way lists are made in actual websites. Interesting fact: using "ul" breaks the paragraph. <br>
            I've also learned about two new tags: &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; and &lt;meta&gt; (also i'm using "&-lt; and &-gt;, without hyphens, to escape the &lt; and &gt; characters). So DOCTYPE specifies the type of document to the browser (which makes sense). In older versions of HTML that doctype tag was a lot more complicated than it had to. The meta tag specifies to the browser, the search engine, etc. metadata about the file - so author, description, charset, keywords, or viewport (whatever that is).
            <br> So far i've updated my file structure and my header - the latter looks like this:
            <br><img src="images/headerupdate.png" alt="annoying code snippet" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br> 
            I'll have to somehow define a class for "code area", so i won't have to keep adding images after each code update. This will get annoying really fast. 
        </p>
        <h1>HTML Basics ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ</h1>
        <p>
            Long story short, HTML scripts are series of multiple enumerated, nested and wrapped elements.<br>
            An HTML element is a thing with tags and content, like this: <i>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</i>.<br>
            Elements can also have attributes. For example <i>&lt;p class="idk"&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</i> has the attribute "class" with the value "idk".<br>
            Elements can be nested, but the tags should close properly (they should be "hugging", not "seqential" or "alternative"). <br>
            Note: Attribute values should generally always be given within double-quotes, even though they're not always necessary for parsing. It's just best practice.<br>
            Elements can also be empty, such as "&lt;img src=...&gt;", which doesn't wrap content to affect it - it just embeds an image. This element has no closing tag and no content, and it's called an "empty element".
        </p>
        <p>
            Bits of the anatomy of an HTML doc:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;html&gt; is called the "root element"</li>
            <li>I was right about the use of the header and body :D</li>
            <li>meta charset utf-8 is boilerplate</li>
            <li>Don't forget about &lt;title&gt;, which shows in the title bar and in google results etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Basics of marking up text according to MDN consists of headings, paragraphs, lists and links. I've been using all of those thus far, except the headings.
        </p> 
        <h3>Finally I can organize my shit (~˘▾˘)~</h3>
        <p>
            Also, I remembered how to write comments. Bet you'll check the source to find my comment. Or maybe you won't. Or maybe there isn't any... or?
            <!--I feel like an NFT. Worthless.-->

        <h1>CSS Basics 🏞️💄📜</h1>
        <p>
            Before starting this module, I'd like to set some goals - since CSS has been the thing holding me back from basic web development for so long. Firstly, let's change this lame default font with something better. Secondly, I want to figure out the basic, most common, CSS properties or however they're called. Thirdly, customize everything from this point on - this includes the borders, fonts, titles, everything. Let's make it obvious that I understand what I'm doing. And fourthly (?) make a class or something similar for centered images and for code snippets, so I won't have to keep copy pasting that image centering styling. </p>
        <p>
            In a more abstract sense - what's css? 
            CSS comes from <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>, and it's not a programming language nor a markup language. It is a <b>style sheet language</b>,
            whatever that means.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an inital example, MDN wants me to create a "styles.css" file which changes the color of paragraphs. I did this, although I'm not really sure what it does: 
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/css-beginning.png" alt="annoying code snippet" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p>
            And now, following the "I don't know what it does" paradigm, I've added this to the header: 
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/css-more-confusion.png" alt="annoying code snippet" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p>
            And behold, shit's fancy now:
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/css-fancy-shit.png" alt="annoying code snippet" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p>
            Now, let's turn it back to black and break down whatever is happening here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anatomy of a CSS ruleset: (and a stolen diagram):
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/css-anatomy-stolen.png" alt="stealing is good" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <ul>
            That whole strcuture is called a "ruleset", or "rule" for short. Now onto the individual parts:
            <li>selector - defines the HTML element to be styled</li>
            <li>declaration - that whole line is called a rule, or a declaration. It defines which one of the element's properties you want to style, and to what</li>
            <li>property - the ways in which you can style an HTML element. In each declaration, you must choose a property to affect and its</li>
            <li>property value - after a colon. This chooses one of the many preset values that a property can take</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Remarks: 
            <li>Apart from the selector, each rulset must be wrapped in {urly brackets.</li>
            <li>A colon must be used to separate a property from the property value or <i>values</i></li>
            <li>To separate each declaration from the ruleset from eachother, you must use a semicolon ;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here's an example with everything from above:
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/rulset-example.png" alt="example" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p>
            Another cool thing is that multiple elements can be selected, and they must be separated by commas, like this: 
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/css-multiple-elements-example.png" alt="example" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p>
            Now - check this out: there are multiple types of selectors. But before that, let me google how to make HTML tables real quick... <br>
            Ok I think i got it - so &lt;table&gt; is the main tag, then &lt;td&gt; is "table data", so a cell. Then &lt;tr&gt; is a "table row". A table has multiple rows, and each row has multiple cells. One more thing - &lt;th&gt; is a "table header". Let's test this:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>This</td>
                <td>is</td>
                <td>probably</td>
                <td>working right?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>it</td>
                <td>do</td>
                <td>be</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Actually, that was a lie. It wasn't really working. The words appeared in the right positions, but for some reason the borders were invisbile (for the table, cells, and the rows (yes they are seperate (i can't imagine why))). What I've had to do was to stackoverflow my way through this - I manually assigned a color and thickness to the borders, to make them render. And of course, I did it in the "styles.css" file :D . It looks something like this:
        </p>
        <br><img src="images/tables-css.png" alt="what mi borders look like in code" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p>
            <b>Back to selectors</b>: as I was saying, there are multiple types of them. The ones I've been using so far are called "element selectors". Let's put the most common ones in a table:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Selector name</th>
                <th>What does it select</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Element selector <br>(aka tag selector or type selector)
                </td>
                <td>All HTML elements of that type</td>
                <td>"p"<br> selects &lt;p&gt;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ID Selector</td>
                <td>The element on the page with the specified ID. <br>IDs must be unique per HTML page</td>
                <td>"#my-id"<br>selects &lt;p id="my-id"&gt;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Class selector</td>
                <td>The element(s) on the page of the specified class</td>
                <td>".my-class"<br>selects &lt;p class="my-class"&gt;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Attribute Selector</td>
                <td>The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute</td>
                <td>"img[src]"<br>selects &lt;img src="ceva.png"&gt;<br>but not &lt;img&gt;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
                <td>The specified element(s) but only when in the specified state</td>
                <td>"a:hover"<br>selects a but only when the mouse is hovering over it</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            (That hover and states thing is quite interesting, i need to find out more about that)
        </p>
        <h2>Fontss</h2>
        <p>Facebook (or Meta, whatever) reaally loves to "get to know me better". This is probably why I started getting quite a lot of web-development related reels onto my Instagram feed. But at least some good things are coming out of that: I keep finding new web development resources! So I've decided to drop that mincraft looking font from the beginning (which I haven't used anyway), and found these new ones: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ultra#standard-styles">Ultra</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono">DM Mono</a>. Let's figure out how to do something with them.</p>
        <p>First, what is that "link" thing in the header that I've previously talked about? From what I can understand, it seems to be something similar to an "import". It basically defines an external relationship between the current document and an external source. In a nutshell: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>link is an empty element, so it contains just attributes</li>
            <li>its syntax looks something like this: <i>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</i></li>
            <li><i>rel</i> is a required attribute, and it specifies the type of relationship. for example: stylesheet, icon, preconnect, etc. (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp">full list here</a>)</li>
            <li><i>href</i> specifies the link to that source</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, I could change the font of the whole page, but for the sake of authenticity and a gradual showcase of my progress, I'll use classes.</p>
        <p>With some CSS magic and by using <i>font-family</i>, I should be able to do <span style="font-family: 'DM Mono', monospace;">something like this! Wow it really works... well this is satisfying haha. Actually, I don't really like this one. Hmm... what about...</span><span style="font-family: 'Ruda', sans-serif;"> this one? Yeah, I do like this one better. It's called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ruda">Ruda.</a> Of course, I'm using <i>&lt;span&gt;</i> to do all of this.</span></p>
        <p class="mtext">But now, THIS IS A CLASS. Looks something like this if you don't believe me:</p>
        <br><img src="images/first-class-css.png" alt="first css class mom" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; width: 50%; "><br>
        <p class="mtext">Let's also get our titles looking sexy:</p>
        <h1 class="mh1">Big new fancy title! Nice. Actually I went back to the Minecraftish font, it looks nice.</h1>
        <h2 class="mh2">And H2, looking good.</h2>
        <p class="mtext">This whole classes thing is temporary. Once I'm done with this module, I'll create a new stylesheet for the next pages.</p>
        <p class="mtext">But before going any further, let's use what I've learned for some QOL improvements:</p>
        <br><img src="images/img-css.png"><br>
        <p class="mtext">This makes adding images a bit less headache-inducing, altough I'm still not really sure what those properties mean. Aaaand:</p>
        <pre><code>
            this should
            kinda work
        </code></pre>
        <p class="mtext">Wow this is wacky but it does work somehow. So I've discovered <i>&lt;code&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;pre&gt;</i>, which help in creating code blocks. It'll still be quite annoying to escape lt and gt, but at least I don't have to keep taking screenshots every 5 minutes :D .</p>
        <pre><code>
            code {
                font-family: 'DM Mono', monospace;
                color: #00aa99;
                font-weight: bold;
            }
            
            pre {
                background-color: #002c36;
            }
        </code></pre>
        <p class="mtext">I'll consider this an acceptable workaround until I'm more competent at CSS and HTML. It <i>may</i> span the entirety of the window, but whatever. I think I'll have to do it with <i>divs</i> or something, when I get to that part.</p>
        <h2 class="mh2">The div is near</h2>
        <p class="mtext">Boxes. We're talking about boxes now: Most HTML elements can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of each other - same with the CSS layout. Each box has properties like: </p>
        <ul class="mtext mul">
            <li>padding, which is the space around the content</li>
            <li>border, which is the solid line just outside the padding</li>
            <li>margin, which is the space outside the border</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mtext">Here's a stolen diagram to put this into perspective:</p>
        <img src="images/box-model.png">
        <p class="mtext">Some additional properties to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul class="mtext mul">
            <li>width, self-explainatory</li>
            <li>backround color - the color behind an element's content and padding</li>
            <li>color - the color of an element's content</li>
            <li>text-shadow - sets a drop shadow on the text inside the element</li>
            <li><i>display</i> - I don't what this this does but it's important</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mtext">Now, instead of modfying the whole body, I'll make a container with everything from this point on (once again, for the sake of authenticity). Soo, let's see... DIV. What it do? -- Hmm so it's pretty easy. Div is basically just a "division", so a container.</p>
        <div style="font-family: 'Ruda', sans-serif;
        font-size: 18px;
        color:#3b3b3b;
        background-color: whitesmoke;
        padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
        border: 2px solid black;
        border-radius: 12px;
        box-shadow: 10px 10px;
        margin: 5px 20px 20px 20px;">
            <p>Woop, here we go. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Actually that's a bit too much... alright this is much better. Let's see what I did: </p>
            <pre><code>
            div {
                font-family: 'Ruda', sans-serif;
                font-size: 18px;
                color:#3b3b3b;
                background-color: whitesmoke;
                padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
                border: 0px;
                border-radius: 12px;
                box-shadow: 8px 6px 10px 5px rgb(173, 173, 173);
                margin: 5px 20px 20px 20px;
            }
            </code></pre>
            <p>Actually, give me a second. I gotta fix something.</p>
            <pre class="code-block"><code>
div {
    font-family: 'Ruda', sans-serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    color:#3b3b3b;
    background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248);
    padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
    border: 0px;
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 8px 6px 10px 5px rgb(173, 173, 173);
    margin: 20px auto;
    max-width: 1000px;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>That's a bit better - although still not great. (Especially since the text overflows if a line is too long, and <i>text-overflow</i> doesn't seem to work. Anyway, that's a problem for 'code-block styling v3'.)</p>
            <p>Back to the div: <i>font-family</i> and <i>font-size</i> are pretty easy, same with <i>color and background-color</i>. The (default) syntax for <i>padding and margin</i> are similar: the first value is the top of the container, the next one is the right side, and so on - it goes clockwise from the top. (i'm explaining at one of the bullet points below what I did with margin). At <i>border</i> i just specify that it should be basically invisible, buuut, at <i>border-radius</i> I'm specifying the corner-radius of said invisible border - funny right? And then there's <i>box-shadow</i>, which I found on google. First two values are "offset-x" and "offset-y"; third is "blur-radius", fourth is "spread-radius" and the last one is the color. LE: I added max-width, which basically makes it so the page is constrained to a column of maximum width of 1000px (unless the window is even smaller, ofc). This also meant that I had to type 'margin' in the way I did - with auto. It's quite annoying that now I can't add a margin if the browser window is less than 1000px. I need to figure out how to add both a margin and center the div in the future.</p>
            <p>More fun facts about these properties:</p>
            <ul class="mul">
                <li>When you set only two values on a property like margin or padding, the first one affects the top and bottom, while the second one is for left and right. The 'auto' keyword devides the available space evenly between two sides.</li>
                <li>All browsers apply default styling to elements. So that's why even though I'm not defining specific fonts, paddings, etc. for the first part of this page, they must still be styled if you think about it. Also, that's why some pages look different on different browsers - the defaults are not always the same. For example if you open this page on Mozilla and then on Chrome, you'll notice <i>slight</i> differences, due to different defaults (such as the fonts, default padding for headers, etc). </li>
                <li>The <i>display</i> property - I'm using that for images, I just realised that! So, to begin with, the &lt;body&gt; element is a 'block' - meaning it takes up space on the page. The margin applied to a block element will be respected by other elements inside the page. In contrast, images are by default 'inline' elements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Alright, so this was just a quick preview of CSS, but I actually learned quite a LOT while going through it, as you can probably tell haha. Next, it gets juicier: </p>
