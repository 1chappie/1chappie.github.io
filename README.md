Web Development Madness!
This project aims to document my journey through web development - as I'm developing it! I'm simultaneously creating and writing a blog about what goes through my head while completing (mostly) the [MDM web development course-guide-thing.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

*The domain 1chappie.github.io itself might not be working right now, because I won't be creating an 'index.html' as of yet; although I'll probably create a placeholder sometime soon.
